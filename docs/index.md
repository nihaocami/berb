# ðŸŽˆ Berb â€“ Peer-to-Peer File Sharing, Simplified

**Berb** is a lightweight, privacy-first web app for sending files directly from one device to another using **WebRTC**. No servers. No uploads. Just you, your file, and the person you want to send it to.

> ðŸ”’ Your files never touch a server â€” Berb connects users directly using WebRTC Data Channels for secure, fast transfers.

## What is Peer-to-Peer (P2P) File Sharing?

P2P file sharing is a method of transferring files directly between two devices, without uploading them to a central server. When you use Berb, your file goes directly from your computer to the recipientâ€™sâ€”encrypted and fast.

This is powered by **WebRTC**, a real-time browser-based communication protocol that creates secure, temporary connections between peers. The file doesnâ€™t touch any server and never gets stored anywhere except your devices.

This means: no cloud, no storage limits, no middlemen, and full privacy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Berb secure?

Yes. All file transfers happen over encrypted WebRTC connections. The data is never stored on any server and is only visible to you and the recipient.

### Is there a file size limit?

1GB (for now). That's not because we don't want to handle larger files. Since Bern uses browser memory to temporarily store files, it depends on your system on how much you can send/receive. We will be addressing this in the near future.

### Do I need to install anything?

Nope! Berb runs entirely in the browser. Just open the link and you're ready to send or receive files.

### What devices are supported?

Berb works on most modern desktop and mobile browsers. For best results, use the latest version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.

### How does the recipient get the file?

Once the sender shares a connection code or link, the recipient opens it and the transfer starts instantlyâ€”no sign-up or account needed.
