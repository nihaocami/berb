# 🎈 Berb – Peer-to-Peer File Sharing, Simplified

**Berb** is a lightweight, privacy-first web app for sending files directly from one device to another using **WebRTC**. No servers. No uploads. Just you, your file, and the person you want to send it to.

> 🔒 Your files never touch a server — Berb connects users directly using WebRTC Data Channels for secure, fast transfers.
